# lemoncode-master-module-7-heroku-same-dyno-back

This is a the backend repository which is used together with the frontend one to launch an app. In this project, we are going to deploy each repository in the same dyno in keroku and we are going to use docker and github actions for that purpose.

We have started from a boilerplate created by [MÃ¡ster Front End Online Lemoncode](https://lemoncode.net/master-frontend#inicio-banner) team.
